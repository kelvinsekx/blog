## Notes
Static type-checking,
Variables: Rust catches a lot of legitimate bugs at compile time. In fact, it will complain of unused variables. Rust ensures being intentional. Even basic logic errors.

While RUst can catch bugs we make in our code, it is beautiful that it can hive us hints before the whole calamity happens.
